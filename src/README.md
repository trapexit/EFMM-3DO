## *Escape from Monster Manor* for the 3DO Console ##

Source code to the 3DO console game *Escape from Monster Manor* (EFMM),
written by me and a team of raving lunatics in 1993 in about six months.
Such valued helpers include:
  * Additional programming:
    * Jon Leupp (Monster Logic)
    * Peter Commons (Streaming Sound)
  * Music and Sound Effects:
    * Bob Vieira
  * Audio Tech and Sound Effects:
    * Phil Burk
  * Artists:
    * Kim Tempest (Animatrix)
    * Stefan Henry-Biskup (Art and Level Design)
    * Liz Beatrice (Level Art)
    * Greg Savoia (Level Art)
  * Chief Zombie:
    * RJ Mical

This is the source code to the game.  The level data and art assets are not
present.  I successfully compiled this once using a resurrected copy of the
ARM Norcroft compiler; your mileage may vary.

If you'd like to better understand what the code is doing, you can watch
the [livestream session(s) I've recorded on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXBXD7ZLLF0xdoKN-tUEkut6R3cfGceG4)
where I give an overview of the code's operation.


## Legal ##

Individuals hoping to play with this code should be aware: From a formal
legal perspective, I don't know who *actually* owns the rights to this
program.

Since I wrote it while working for New Technologies Group (NTG), I believe,
and on that basis allege, that the code was owned by NTG.  EFMM was
published by Electronic Arts but, to the best of my knowledge, was not
*sold* to them.  When NTG was acquired by 3DO, the copyrights presumably
transferred to them.  However, when 3DO declared bankruptcy in 2003, all
their assets were sold at bankruptcy auction, and the rights to various
properties were essentially scattered to the four winds.  I don't know who,
if anyone, acquired the copyrights to EFMM, nor do I have any way of finding
out.  Ergo:  *Caveat Codor.*
