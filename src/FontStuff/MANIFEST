	This directory contains the source code to Greg Omi's font system.
The file 'NormalBuildOutput' contains the MPW/armcc output to be expected
from a normal successful build.

	One built, the files "font.co" and "font.so" should be copied to the
directory containing the EFMM sources.

	The file 'mm.font' contains the font imagery used by EFMM.  I do not
know how this file is created.  For more info, contact Greg Omi or Jon Leupp
at (415) 494-1600.
