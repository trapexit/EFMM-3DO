 *
 * elkabong.c:	Defense against bug in filesystem version XX.XX.
 *		Nomenclature by Dave Platt.
 *
 * Description Of Bug:
 *	The Opera Filesystem (release versions 1.1 and earlier) have a bug
 *	that may cause synchronous I/O operations to jam, manifesting as a
 *	program lockup.  This bug is triggered by posting a high-priority
 *	asynchronous I/O request to a file, then AbortIO()ing it before it
 *	is processed.  The filesystem's internal priority level is not
 *	reset, and the next I/O request to arrive will be queued but not
 *	processed (since it is believed to be of lower priority).  However,
 *	it's arrival will trigger a recalculation of the internal priority
 *	level, and subsequent I/O requests will be processed, in addition to
 *	releasing and processing the jammed one.
 *
 * Workaround Theory Of Operation:
 *	This source module basically caters to the problem by posting an
 *	asynchronous CMD_READ request which is anticipated to jam.  Then a
 *	second synchronous request is issued which is expected to complete
 *	and un-jam the first.  All subsequent I/O should then behave
 *	normally.
 *
 *	Note:  The file must be open before this operation is done, since
 *	OpenDiskFile() may cause a read of the directory.  Such a read would
 *	jam, and OpenDiskFile() would not complete.
 *
 *	This operation is not performed on filesystem versions later than
 *	XX.XX.
