SYNOPSIS
	ctst [ -c ] [ -l<sequencefile> ] [ -a# ] [ -s# ] [ -x# ]

OPTIONS
	-c:	"Cheat" mode, otherwise known as LAYTEST mode.  In this
		mode, pressing the PAUSE key on the joypad will exit the
		current level, advancing you to the next.  (You don't get to
		see the endgame, though.)  This is useful when gathering
		file access statistics for building an optimized CD-ROM
		image.

	-l<filename>:
		Specify file containing level sequence.  If absent, the file
		named "LevelSequence" is used.

	-a#:	Specify the player's acceleration rate.  That is, the rate
		at which the player reaches maximum motive and rotational
		speed.  Default value is 0x24000.  Larger values accelerate
		faster.  Values smaller than 0x18000 accelerate very slowly.
		Values less than 0x10000 should not be used, as you are
		unable to overcome "friction."

	-s#:	Specify the player's decelleration rate; the rate at which
		the player slows to a stop when not pressing the joypad.
		Default value is 4.  Smaller values stop quicker.  0 is
		"PosiDrive," 7 or higher gets you SpaceWars.

	-x#:	The number of points for an extra life.  Default is 500000.


EXAMPLES
	ctst -x750000 -lToughLevels

	ctst -a0x16000 -s7 -c

NOTE
	For the arguments -l, -a, -s, and -x, there can be no space between
	the option letter and the value.
